**_POSSIBLY INTERVIEVE IN SOME RECIPES AND RESERTAUNTS TO HELP USER DECIDE_**

my favorite way to use Claude Code to build large features is spec based

start with a minimal spec or prompt and ask Claude to interview you using the AskUserQuestionTool

then make a new session to execute the spec

read this @SPEC.md and interview me in detail using the
AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical
implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make
sure the questions are not obvious

be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until
it's complete, then write the spec to the file

1. move recipes to top?
2. smooth scrolling
3. rate limiting (redis?)
